## Hi friends 

My name is Meina Gong (she/her). I was born and raised in Jian, Jiangxi, and I am currently a developer.

I am deeply interested in studying technology that impact web growth and development, most specifically user experience design. Long term, I also hope to contribute by supporting children of their conditions and circumstances, so they feel supported by technology and science.

I wasnâ€™t always convince I was smart enough to do engineering jobs, but during my volunteer year at Jamaica I was lucky to meet amazing engineers who helpd me realize my passion for science and helped me pursue this path. I also fell in love with Jamaica and made some incredible friends there!

My other lifelong passion is volunteering: I volunteer in 2018, and although I cannot volunteer due to the pandemic, volunteering continue to be an important and meaningful part of my life.

I love spicy and fish, the color pink, reading, traveling, and jogging. I value the human connection, presence, and people with integrity. I   hope some of what I share resonates with you, and while I know I have a lot to learn, I appreciate you all being part of my journey.
